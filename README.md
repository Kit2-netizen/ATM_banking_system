# ATM_banking_system
To develop this interface, I use C# programming language and SQL database server.👩‍💻

Atm Banking system has user and admin panel, where the user needs to enter pin code which is included in the database already. Also user can convert currency,get a loan,deposit,withdraw his/her money and can update his statement form. Admin can add new user and also a admin can update, delete, edit any user information.

*Create an issue if something went wrong, I'll fix.👩‍🔧
*Thank you!
